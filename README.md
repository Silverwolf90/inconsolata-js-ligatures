# Inconsolata + JavaScript Ligatures

This is the font of Inconsolata with some ligatures mostly useful for people writing JavaScript. There are a few other modifications in addition to ligatures. All the ligatures were originally taken from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) although I slightly modified some.

### Ligatures

* `===` Strict equal
* `!==` Strict not equal
* `=>` Arrow Functions
* `<=` Less than or equal to
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `||` Or
* `&&` And

### Other Modifications

* Single and Double quotes are now straight - used the glyphs in [Inconsolata-dz](http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/)
