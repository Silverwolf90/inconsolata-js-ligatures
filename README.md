# Inconsolata + JavaScript Ligatures

This is the font of Inconsolata with some ligatures mostly only useful for people writing JavaScript. There are a few other modifications in addition to the ligatures. All the ligatures were originally taken from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) although I made some slight modifications.

I've never used FontForge before and I kind of stumbled through the program, so it's  more than likely I didn't do stuff according to best practices but it seems to work.

### Ligatures

* `===` Strict equal
* `!==` Strict not equal
* `=>` Arrow Functions
* `<=` Less than or equal to
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `||` Or
* `&&` And

* Single and Double quotes are now straight - used the glyphs in [Inconsolata-dz](http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/)
